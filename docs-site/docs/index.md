# ðŸ‘€ Mind Cursor â€“ Navigate the Web with Your Eyes and Voice

Mind Cursor is a Chrome extension designed to improve web accessibility for people with limited hand mobility â€” such as those with severe illnesses, disabilities, or the elderly.

Most websites are built for mouse and keyboard control, making them difficult to navigate for users with physical limitations. Our solution enables full page control using only **eye movements and voice commands**.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- Control a virtual mouse with your **gaze**: move, click, scroll
- Use **voice commands** interpreted by Gemini to browse or trigger actions
- **No expensive devices required** â€” simple and free to install
